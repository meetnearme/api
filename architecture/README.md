# Meet Near Me Architecture

Primarily this is a place for proposing new architecture and schema designs. The
assumption is that we will use tools like
[mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/edit),
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), via it's
[Schema Generator](https://pmk65.github.io/jedemov2/dist/demo.html), an
interactive [Playground](https://json-editor.github.io/json-editor/), and maybe
[this JSON Schema => Mermaid library](https://jsitor.com/BBMYqTkZ3) to visualize
and have the code in this repository act as the source of truth for diagrams,
etc. so that there are not multiple conflicting documents and the JSON schema
can act as the source of truth for

- the database schema
- validation layer in application controller code
- source of truth for discussion, refinement, and PRs for changes
